- 👋 Hi, I’m @kvelardi (Kristen)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning computer software engineering.  Currently I am in an software engineering bootcamp to learn the basic skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the front end of software development.  For example I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS.  I am now learning about ES 2015 JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects where I can learn from experienced engineers who are looking to mentor and guide someone who is starting out in their career.
- 📫 You can reach me by sending an email to me kristenvelardi@gmail.com
